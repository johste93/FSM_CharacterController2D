# FSM_CharacterController2D
A "one touch" 2D final state machine character controller I wrote for my game Safari Forever.

Notable states include:

Idle,
Falling,
Running,
Jumping
Fluttering,
Wallsliding,
Walljumping

The character can also be affected by external physics forces.
Demo includes jump pad and conveyor belt forces.

Easy to modify and extend with your own states.

This controller was written in Unity 2018.3.1f1
